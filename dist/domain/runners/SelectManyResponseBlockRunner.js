/**
 * Block runner for `MobilePrimitives\SelectManyResponse` - Obtains the answer to a Multiple Choice question from the
 * contact. The contact can choose many choices from a set of choices.
 *
 * - text (SMS): Send an SMS with the prompt text, according to the prompt configuration in config above, and wait to
 *   capture a response. (Lack a response after the flow's configured timeout, or an invalid response: proceed through
 *   the error exit.)
 * - text (USSD): Display a USSD menu prompt with the prompt text, according to the prompt configuration in config
 *   above, then wait to capture the menu response. (Dismissal of the session, timeout, or invalid response: proceed
 *   through the error exit.)
 * - ivr: Play the audio prompt, according to the prompt configuration in config above, then wait to capture the DTMF
 *   response. (Hangup, timeout, or invalid response: proceed through the error exit.)
 * - rich_messaging: Display the prompt text according to the prompt configuration in config above. Platforms may wait
 *   to capture a text response, or display rich menu items for each choice and wait to capture a menu choice.
 *   (If displaying menu items, platforms should display only question_prompt.) (Timeout or invalid response: proceed
 *   through the error exit.)
 * - offline: Display the prompt text according to question_prompt, and a menu of items for all choices. Wait to capture
 *   a menu selection.
